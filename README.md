# React Native: Unexpected Prop Type

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: receiving an unexpected prop type in a component. The error arises when a component receives a prop of a different type than what it expects. This often occurs in asynchronous operations where a prop might not be immediately available.

The `UnexpectedPropType.js` file shows the incorrect implementation leading to the error. The solution is provided in `UnexpectedPropTypeSolution.js`.
