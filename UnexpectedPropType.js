This error occurs when using a component that expects a specific prop type, such as a function, but is instead provided with a value of a different type.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations or callbacks. For example, if a component expects an `onPress` prop (function), but receives `null` or `undefined`, this error can result.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
<MyComponent onPress={null} />
```

```javascript
// Correct usage
<MyComponent onPress={() => {/* Your logic here */}} />
```
